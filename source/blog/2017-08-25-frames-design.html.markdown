Diamond Frame

<p class="layout-main__paragraph"> 
In the U.S this is the preferred frame style for male riders. The diamond frame also provides the better support of these two options being discussed. The top tube offers more structure stability and rigidity to the frame with minimizes frame flexing and allows for you to ride it at higher speeds. Diamond frames also be made from lighter gauge tubing which makes the bike itself lighter. A lighter bike probably won't be a huge factor for you, especially if you are just starting off riding, but it is something you should keep in mind for the furture if you want to start doing timed events. The main disadvantage of the diamond frame is going to be the effect on your riding posture. Even with seat and stem adjustment many riders will find that they are leaned over the top tube of the frame which puts stress on the wrists, shoulders, and lower back. If these are already problem areas for you then you might want to look at a step through frame.

Step Through Frame
<!-- INSERT PHOTO -->

<p class="layout-main__paragraph">
For some reason the many people in the U.S. think of step-through frame bikes as women's bikes. However, both men and women across the globe use step-through frames on a daily basis. These bikes tend to be used for leisurely rides or short commutes on well paved surfaces. The main problem with this design is that the frame can flex higher speed and greater load, but you probably won't be entering a race with this kind of bike frame either. Step through frames are generally fabricated from heavier gauge tubing which lowers the potential for frame to shear or bend permanently, and they also has a longer head tube and higher stem with a shorter seat tube which allows for the rider to side in a more upright position and allows for better posture while riding. This is ideal for those riders that suffer from lower back problems and also takes pressure off of the shoulders and wrists. If the majority of your riding will be on flat roads and surfaces at a slower speed then this frame would work well for you.
