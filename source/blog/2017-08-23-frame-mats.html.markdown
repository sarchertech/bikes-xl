<p class="layout-main__paragraph"> 
A sturdy frame is the core of a good bike. If your bike has a weak frame parts may fit poorly - or not at all - and a compromised frame could be potential hazardous when riding. Trust me when I say you don't want part of your frame shearing off at any point, espeically when you are on it. Typically frames come in four different materials: aluminum, steel, titanium, and carbon. Carbon and titanium frames are going to be the most expensive frames you will find, and titanium is usually going to be reserved for custom frame builds. If you can't afford to get a custom frame built then we are left with two options: steel and aluminum. Between the two, aluminum is going to be the lighter of the two but steel is going to clearly be stronger - even compared to carbon.
