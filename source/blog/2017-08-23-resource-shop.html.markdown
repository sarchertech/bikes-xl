Owning a bike takes a bit of maintenance. It isn't as simple as hoping on your bike whenever you want and going for a ride. Well, I mean, it is. Just be sure to check your tire pressure and make sure everything feels good. Proper and frequent bike maintenance will help ensure your bike lasts for many years and you get many miles out of it. Here are a few tools and pieces of equipment you really should own to keep your bike in proper working order.
</p>

<h1 class="layout-main__h1">
Repair Stands
</h1>
<p class="layout-main__paragraph">
I highly recommend learning how to do your own bike maintenance and repair. One piece of equipment that - while not essential - will help tremendously is a repair stand. Repair stands help get the bike up to a more managable height rather than having you crouch, stoop, or bend down to see and repair your bike's problem.
<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.jensonusa.com/Park-Tool-PCS-10-Home-Mech-Repair-Stand">Park Tool PCS-10</a> has a quick release on the extension tube and on the folding tube for easy set up and break down. This stand also has a additional accessory attachment ports that provide you with easier access to your tools or shop towels. 
<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.jensonusa.com/Park-Tool-PCS-4-1-Deluxe-Home-Stand">Park Tool PCS-4-1</a> has a 4-point leg system provides great stability. Unlike the PCS-10 and the PRS-25 the legs on the PCS-4-1 collapse - rather than folding upwards - which allow it to be mounted to a wall or stored away in tight spaces. 
<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.jensonusa.com/Park-Tool-PRS-25-Team-Portable-Stand">Park Tool PRS-25</a> is very similar in design to the PCS-10 but is made from aluminum, rather than steel like the PCS-10. The frame clamp is diecast and can grip any tube from 7/8" to 3".

Bike maintenance is best done at home or at the shop, but you never know when something might happen while on the road. Here is a selection of compact bike tools that are small enough for you to bring with you on your rides without being to cumbersome but can also fix most basic problems.

Floor Pumps
</h1>
<p class="layout-main__paragraph">
There aren't too many things worse than getting a flat tire while riding. Especially if you are more than a few miles away from your car. That's why it is important to check your tire pressure before every ride. Here are some floor pumps that and help you make sure you are ready to ride.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Topeak-Blow-Sport-Floor-Pump/dp/B002B7LTBY">Topeak Sport II Floor Pump</a> features a built in pressure gauge and a double sided pump head that fits both Presta and Schrader valves. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nashbar-Earl-Grey-Floor-Pump/dp/B00EYI8PN8">Nashbar Earl Grey Floor Pump</a> allows you to pump up to 160psi quickly and easily. This pump also features an extra large gauge that makes reading your tire pressure super simple.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/AerGun-X-1000-Bike-Pump-AerTight/dp/B01M1RM4CT">AerGun X-1000 Bike Pump</a> has an easy to read pressure gauge, a pump head with a pressure release valve, and durable steel air chamber. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Performance-Glueless-Puncture-T-Valve-Schrader/dp/B017ADD9N4">Vibrelli Performance Bike Floor Pump</a> has a double sided pump head to fit both Presta and Schrader valves, precision pressure gauge, and also comes with a glueless puncture kit.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Topeak-Blow-Booster-Floor-Pump/dp/B0187ZRPPC">Topeak Joe Blow Booster Floor Pump</a> is a bit pricey compared to these other pumps but is also unique in that it acts as a sort of pump/compressor combo. The pressure gauge can be turned to either inflate or charge. When set to charge the air remains contained within the barrel until you reach your desired PSI and the knob is then switched back to inflate. All of the air then rushes into the tire at once rather than with one pump at a time like most floor pumps.

Seat Cusions
</h1>
<p>
In a <a href="/blog/accessories/seats/">previous blog post about seats</a> I mentioned using a seat cusion or a saddle to add a little extra cushioned during your ride. As bike manufacturers continue to redesign bikes to look sleek and sporty, comfort often times falls by the wayside. This extra cushioning can help make a long ride much more comfortable. Here are a few cushions and saddles that may help you during such rides.
<br>
<br>
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Cushion-Cover-Domain-Cycling/dp/B015VJ9GTA">Domain Gel Seat Cover</a> is one of the most popular cushions on that market and was designed specifically for spin classes, but also works perfectly for outdoor riding and even on a standard indoor exercise bike. The soft silicone gel gives you great cushioning while also conforming to the shape of your seat.

This cushion can also fit standard bike seats, as well as spin bikes and other indoor stationary bikes. 
<br>
<br>
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aduro-Cushion-Memory-Bicycle-Installation/dp/B0746RS5FL">Aduro Sport Bike Seat Cushion</a> is a memory foam seat cushion made from a breathable, water and weather resistant Lycra. It is made to fit most narrow road-bike style seats and also has a grooved design for air ventilation and cooling.
